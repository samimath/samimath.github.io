This is a series of posts that explore how to gather, clean, analyze, and generate insights from the data. In my last post, I've shared an example of calling the open FDA API to get data relevant to adverse events reported through [FAERS (FDA Adverse Events Reporting System)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/questions-and-answers-fdas-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers/fda-adverse-event-reporting-system-faers-public-dashboard).

In this post, I'd like to understand the data a bit better using some visualization and feature generation.


# Get a sense of the sample data:

- The sample of data we pulled has 63800 rows and 85 columns, with event dates ranging from January 2010 to March 2020. Note: the total data set consists of millions of records, and the data we are working with here is only a small part of it.

- There are quite a few columns with incomplete data, we'll need to do some data QC to select more useful features

- While some data is not missing, they may still be non-informative if e.g. there is only 1 unique value
