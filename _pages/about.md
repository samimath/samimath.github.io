# Hey there!

My name is Sami, I'm currently working as a data scientist with training in math, and music. I am originally from Macau, a tiny seaside city in South Eastern China that is now known as Vegas in the East due to its large gambling and tourism industry. Historical fun fact : Macau is simultaneously [the first and the last European colony in Asia](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1999-12-22-9912220059-story.html). In my spare time, I enjoy being in the outdoors, cooking, playing music, and learning new things.

This is my personal website I'll occasionally share things about exploratory data analysis, machine learning, visualization, and also, cats.
