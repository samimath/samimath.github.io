   *  Partner with a global team of domain experts and business leaders to define the content and roadmap of analytics strategy, and serve as a liaison between technical teams and business leaders to translate the value of analytics models and identify business use cases.
   *   Provide technical leadership and supervision for a team of data scientists on data requirements, modeling approach, validation, statistical analyses, visualization and documentation.
   *   Define best practices for modeling work including data integrity, data science best practice (e.g. version control and code-review), model quality and documentation of analytics development.


* **Data Scientist, [Bayer Crop Science](https://www.bayer.com/en/crop-science-innovations-data-science.aspx) (May 2016 - Nov 2019)**

   * Delivered analytics solutions for the supply chain organization by developing an end-to-end pipeline from data ingestion, model selection and validation, to reporting for business partners.
   * Independently responsible for technical tasks including data wrangling, exploratory analyses, data querying (e.g. using different internal API’s and database query), model building and validation, code refactoring,
  building multiple visualization tools, and documentation.
   * Learned and assessed analytics platforms such as Domino data lab, AWS, Datarobot and Sagemaker.
   * Organized internal data science educational programs such as Python data wrangling workshops, participated in data science hackathon, and presented at internal symposiums and conferences.


* **Analytics Co-Op, Monsanto Co. (Jan - July 2015)**

   * Developed a change-point detection model for Monsanto’s first IoT platform to assess data quality for combine harvesters, and mitigate data loss of plot information due to device failure.
   * Supported the deployment of real-time anomaly detection algorithm in FieldDrive’s framework through collaboration with IT, engineering and analytics teams.
   * Supported the model development for numerous microbial field trials by analyzing the ranking consistency of microbial products, and geospatial properties of the fitted results across a set of different models.


* **Research Intern, [Medical College of Wisconsin](https://www.mcw.edu/) (part-time Jan 2012 - Jan 2014)**

  * Worked closely with researchers at the Max McGee Research Center for Juvenile Diabetes to develop quantitative algorithms to select genetic markers associated with early-onset type one diabetes based on data from human clinical trials.
  * Provided technical support for progress reports for grants, clinical programs, and academic journal articles.


* **Research Assistant, University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee (2014)**


  * Designed, implemented, and evaluated an Expectation Maximization (EM)-based parameter estimation
algorithm for correlated random field with missing observations.
  * Presented at mathematical conferences and participated at several applied math workshops.
